If the command "look under rock" is entered, a player should look under a rock and then be stung by a scorpion. It should do 3 damage and poison the player by turning the "poisoned" variable to true. Then the "scorpion_present" variable should be change to false so that the player can only be stung once. Text alluding to the presence of the rock should be included in the explore action. If in deathwish mode, the scorpion is a (research most deadly scorpion) and kills the player instantly by setting health = 0.
