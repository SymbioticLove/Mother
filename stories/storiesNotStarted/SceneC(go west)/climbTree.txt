The player should be able to attempt to climb a tree. If their health is equal to or higher than 10, they should successfully climb the tree and see something glinting off of another tree in the distance. This should be represented by a new variable ("SceneC_tree_climbed = True). If their health is lower than 10, they should recieve a message similar to, "You try to climb the tree, but you aren't strong enough and you fall." and they should lose 3 health. This should activate a new variable, "attempted_climb1" to prevent a second loss of health. If "attempted_climb1" is true and the player's health remains at or below 10, a message saying "You already hurt yourself once." or something similar should be displayed.
