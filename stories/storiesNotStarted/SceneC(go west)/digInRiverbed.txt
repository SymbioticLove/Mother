If the can_dig1 variable is true, the player should be able to use a new command "dig" to dig up whatever is in the riverbed. It is a cat skull. The player knows this offhand, but doesn't understand how. If the player's morality is equal to or less than 20, they should take the cat skull ("has_cat_skull = True). If it is higher than 20, the should drop it and recoil, and a variable called "recoiled_at_skull" should become true, preventing this same action again in either case. The "dig" command should return "You already dug up the skull." in the former case, or "You're not going anywhere near that skull again!" in the latter.
