if the variable "SceneC_tree_climbed" is true, a new command, "Investigate" should allow the player to investigate the glinting item they saw. It turns out to be a nail that they saw the glint off of. The nail is holding a note. The note should tell you some natural history of the forest you're located in. By the base of the tree, you should find 3 9mm bullets. You should only take these if your morality is equal to or lower than 35. If it is higher, you should leave them.
