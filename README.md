Welcome to my ongoing project to create THE definitive text adventure. With hand-drawn stylings, music composed, played and recorded by us, authentic and deep sound design as well as a brilliant interactive story.

Currently, the only output is to the cmd prompt opened with the game. You will need to type commands into the console in the game, and the results will be printed to the external cmd prompt. This will be changed, obviously, but you've gotta build before you paint.

The background variable "morality" will control many of the available options and brances, as well as myriad other factors. This game should ultimately provide many, many hours of satisfying reveals and twists that you either didn't expect or will not be able to reliably recreate.

Each run through is it's own run, informed only by the knowledge of your previous attempts. To truly find everything this game has to offer should take 10s, if not hundreds, of playthroughs.

If you'd like to run the game for yourself right now, you'll need to install Python and Pygame. Instructions can be found here -> https://chat.openai.com/share/ebf921f5-262c-4eb3-b896-d67c0a6cbeb2

Be sure to create a new folder somewhere to hold everything within the repository. It all must be together. To run this program, open a cmd prompt and navigate to the folder you created using the "cd" (change directory) command:

cd c:\mother

This will place you inside the mother folder. Once inside this folder, type the command "python mother.py"

c:\mother>python mother.py

The game will launch. Please send any feedback to support@symbiotic.love! You can pre-order here -> https://shop.symbiotic.love/collections/our-games
